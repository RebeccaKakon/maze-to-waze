if you have a graph and you want to find different ways to travel in your graph , our project can help you with that . 
you can find the shortes way to a  specific point you want to reach.
If you are a taxi driver that need to pick up several people that means you must visit every location for everyone you pick up,
so we built for you the perfect algoritem that will do so .
And do not worry if you want to built your own graph or you want to see how the methods that we bulid for you are affecting the graph 
we have a Gui class that will amaze you .

This project represent 5 calsses:
nodedata Class - will create our nodes of the graph
edgedata Class - will creade our edges of the graph
DGraph Class - will build a graph by points and edges 
GUI Class-will draw the graph.
Graph_Algo Class- In this class we have difrent algoritems that solve diffrents problems on our graph! -save,load,short pass between locations, and others

For more information about our project you can read on our wiki.
