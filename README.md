# maze-to-waze


if you have a graph and you want to find different ways to travel in your graph , our project can help you with that . 
you can find the shortes way to a A specific point you want to reach.
if you are a taxi driver that need to pick up several people that means you must visit every location for everyone you pick up. 
so we builtfor you a algoritem that will do it .
and do not worry if you want to built your own graph or you want to see how the methods that we bulid for you are affecting the graph 
we have a Gui class that will amaze you .

This project represent 5 calsses:
nodedata Class - will creat our node of the graph
edgedata Class - will creat our edge of the graph
DGraph Class - will build a graph that that its built by points and edges. each graph contain a collection of node (with the help of 
nodedata class) and a collectiom of edges (with the help of edgedata class)
GUI Class-will draw the graph.
Graph_Algo Class- In this class we have difrent algoritems that solve diffrents problems on our graph!
